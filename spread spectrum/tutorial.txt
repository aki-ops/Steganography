The program is used to hide and decode images using the spread spectrum method.
The program includes 2 main parts:
Embed message: embed a secret message in the photo
Decode: decode the message from the stego image

The directory includes 3 files:
spread spectrum.py: Main program file, responsible for embedding and decoding messages
message.txt: folder containing the message to embed (in binary form)
decrypted_message.txt : folder containing the secret message after the image is decrypted


Instructions for running the code:
1. Embed secret message
- Write a secret message into the message.txt file
- Go to file spread spectrum.py and edit
- Edit the path to the image (line 17)
- Run and the program will produce a stego image file (stego_image)

2. Decode the message
- Edit the path to the stego image (line 61)
- Enter message length (line 66)
- Run the code and the program will display the message embedded in the decrypted_message.txt file
